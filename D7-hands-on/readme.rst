Docker and virtualization 
--------------------------

In this exercise we will use mainly the for b2X nodes on Cosilt cluster  in an interactive way.

Steps:

- guided tutorial: configure/play with basic docker commands 
- exercise 1: measure overhead of docker container on HPL benchmark 
- exercise 2: create your own docker container for scientific application and play with them 

Part 1: configure with basic docker commands

exercise 2: create your own docker container for scientific application and play with them
___________________________________________________________________________________________

Each group is supposed to create a docker image that automatically install scientific package and then run some tests.
Students have to measure performance within the docker and on the real nodes and then compare/discuss differences (if any) in performance.

Selected scientific applications:
 - Quantum Espresso
 - LAMMPS
 - RegCM 
 - HPL
